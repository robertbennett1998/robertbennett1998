## Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a software engineer working within the areospace industry; I am currently working on Future Software Architectures for airborne software.

### I am currently working on...
[K&EK Trophies](https://github.com/robertbennett1998/kektrophies), a website for a family member to replace the existing (now old) one. The code aims to be clean and attempts to follow best practice without over engineering it for its purpose. I have recently reintegrated the old repositories for this project and set up CI pipelines to push the changes to the web server. There is a staging branch and a master branch, these transfer the files to the web server when a push is made to the branches. The website can be found at [kektrophies.co.uk](https://kektrophies.co.uk/) and the staging site should be accessible through [staging.kektrophies.co.uk](https://staging.kektrophies.co.uk/).

[NvqScaper](https://github.com/robertbennett1998/NvqScaper) with a friend from work. NvqScaper performs a gap analysis on our [Learning Assistant]() profiles making it easier to see which performance or skill criterias we have yet to meet. This has been quickly put together as we needed it immediatly to complete our diploma over the next couple of months. We will be adding to it and refactoring were needed so it can be useful for future cohorts of apprentices.

### Why not have a look at...
[hyperparameter_optimisation_library](https://github.com/robertbennett1998/hyperparameter_optimisation_library), a hyperparameter optimisation library for Keras; written for my dissertation as part of my BSc (Hons) in Computer Science. The aim was to provide a reusable framework to perform experiments with various hyperparemter optimisation algorithms. Three were implemented Random Search, Genetic Algorithm and a Random Forest with a Bayesian surrogate function.

[bird_classification](https://github.com/robertbennett1998/bird_classification), a neural network that makes use of the [hyperparameter optimisationh library](https://github.com/robertbennett1998/hyperparameter_optimisation_library) to classify ~150 species of [birds](https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species/version/14). The optimised network achived a validation accuracy 88%. 

[OneShotEngine](https://github.com/robertbennett1998/OneShotEngine), a long term project exploring DirectX and game engines. Its best to look at the [development](https://github.com/robertbennett1998/OneShotEngine/tree/development) branch.

[DistributedSystems](https://github.com/robertbennett1998/DistributedSystems), course work for the distributed systems module. We were required to implement a REST API and a client to access the API via a CLI. For the client I started to create a quick CLI framework that would detect "command" methods and parse the input string.

[LanguagesAndCompilers](https://github.com/robertbennett1998/LanguagesAndCompilers), While the code is a true horror, due to not wanting to break the lecturers test scripts and the repository itself is no better. The module was very interesting and it was pretty cool compiling a calculator in a language I had written the compiler for. To see the final compiler have a look in this [folder](https://github.com/robertbennett1998/LanguagesAndCompilers/tree/master/SplCompiler); where you will also find a readme explaining it, how to use it and the various optimisations implemented.
